## First the model starts by having you create your character
- Choose a class
- use rag implemtentation to give the player an insight into all the characters
- choose a name
- Get assigned random stats
- get starting weapons
- all of this is stored somewhere so the model can get this information

## Adventure Begins
- The model will give the player different prompts, the player will then tell the model what they want to do
