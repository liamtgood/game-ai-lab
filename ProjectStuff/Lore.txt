# Dungeons & Dragons Magic Items

## Bag of Holding
This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.

## Deck of Many Things
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect.

## Vorpal Sword
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head.

## Ring of Invisibility
While wearing this ring, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until you use a bonus action to become visible again.

## Staff of the Magi
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls. The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. When you cast a spell from the staff, you can choose to expend 1 or more additional charges to increase the spell's level. The staff regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn.

## Portable Hole
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter. When placed on a surface and commanded to open, it creates a 10-foot-deep cylindrical hole. The hole is ringed with a 2-foot-wide band of cloth at the top. The portable hole remains in place until you use an action to grasp the edge of the cloth and fold it up. If living beings are within the hole when it's folded up, they're transported to the Astral Plane. 

## The Sword of Light
This radiant blade glows with an inner light, illuminating a 20-foot radius around you while dim light extends for an additional 20 feet.

## Treasure of the Lost Gods
This ancient artifact is said to have been created by the gods themselves and lost to time. The treasure is a collection of powerful relics, each imbued with divine magic. When attuned to the treasure, you gain the ability to cast the spell "Divine Favor" at will. Additionally, the treasure grants you resistance to radiant and necrotic damage. However, the power of the treasure comes at a cost: prolonged use may attract the attention of celestial or fiendish beings seeking to reclaim it.

## Shield of Ares
This shield is said to have been forged by the god of war himself. While wielding the Shield of Ares, you gain a +3 bonus to your AC. Additionally, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 force damage to the attacker. The shield also has 3 charges.

## Serpant's Tounge
This magical item takes the form of a silver tongue-shaped amulet. While wearing it, you gain advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks. Additionally, once per day, you can cast the spell "Suggestion" (save DC 14) without expending a spell slot. The amulet regains this ability at dawn.

## Key to the Underworld
This ancient key is said to unlock the gates to the Underworld. While holding the Key to the Underworld, you can cast the spell "Plane Shift" once per day without expending a spell slot, but only to travel to or from the Underworld. Additionally, undead creatures within 30 feet of you are hostile unless you succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check to pacify them. The key is indestructible and radiates an aura of necrotic energy.

## Cloak of Shadows
This dark, hooded cloak allows you to blend seamlessly into the darkness. While wearing the Cloak of Shadows, you can use an action to become invisible in dim light or darkness. The invisibility lasts until you move into bright light, attack, or cast a spell. Additionally, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made in dim light or darkness.

## Boots of Swiftness
These enchanted boots increase your speed and agility. While wearing the Boots of Swiftness, your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you can use a bonus action to take the Dash action.
